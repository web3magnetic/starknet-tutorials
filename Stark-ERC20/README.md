# ERC20 Basics on StarkNet

In this example, we are going to see how to deploy a simple ERC 20 token contract to  Starknet, and mint some tokens. 

# Getting Started

First clone the git or download the git and unzip it.   

You need to run terminal (on MAC) in the downloaded folder, or open the folder in Virtual Studio Code (windows), and this will be your developing platform.  
Mac: To open terminal in the folder, right click folder and select  "New Terminal at Folder".
In this case, we will be performing all these tasks within the "Stark-ERC20" folder on your terminal environment. So please make sure you are executing within this folder. 


In the terminal, enter one by one:    


pip3 install cairo-lang  
python3 -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  
pip install cairo-nile  

nile init  

# Compiling and Deploying  

To compile, run the commands:  

nile compile  

On comliling with the above command, we will see the following messages:  

🤖 Compiling all Cairo contracts in the contracts directory  
🔨 Compiling contracts/contract.cairo  
🔨 Compiling contracts/ERC20_base.cairo  
🔨 Compiling contracts/Deploy_ERC20.cairo  
✅ Done  

Now the contract is compiled, we will deploy it:  


Run:  


nile deploy Deploy_ERC20 NAME SYMBOL SUPPLY 0 ADDRESS --network goerli    

Here, NAME SYMBOL and SUPPLY should be in 'felt' format.   
To convert a number or string into felt, please use this tool : https://cairo-utils-web.vercel.app

  
  A '0' is placed after Supply, since Supply is a large integer and on converting to felt, it will be a felt array. 

  The Address will contain the address to deploy the contract to. This will be your ArgentX wallet address.

Example of correct deploy code:
  
  
nile deploy Deploy_ERC20 1146178124 1146178124 470000000000000000000 0 0x6E113C63B19D65cBEBfC7FeD0E4789FB442Cc352 --network goerli  

Once the deploy command is completed, you will see the message:  
🚀 Deploying Deploy_ERC20    
⏳ ️Deployment of Deploy_ERC20 successfully sent at XXXXXX  
🧾 Transaction hash:  
📦 Registering XXXXXX  

Now, you can go to the registered address on Voyager Goerli, and use Write contract to claim some tokens from the faucet.
